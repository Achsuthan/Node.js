<>   before we start npm we have to run a command 
        'npm init'
    it will ask some questions 

<>  instead of running 'npm init', we can run 
        'npm init --yes'
    it wond't ask any question

<> when we run npm install <package_name> in the package.json file will put that pacakge_name under dependancies 

<> if we want to ignore the npm_module we have to create .gitignore file and add the node_modules

<> 'npm list' will give all the node_modules

<> list down dependencies of specific node_moduel
        'npm view <package_name> dependancies'
